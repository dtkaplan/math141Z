<h2>MMAC Chapter 1</h2>
<p>This tutorial covers the R commands used in Chapter 1 of Kilty and McAllister’s <em>Mathematical Modeling and Applied Calculus</em>. You can ignore the “Working in RStudio” sections in the book itself.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, you will learn</p>
<ul>
<li>How to implement a mathematical formula as an R function.</li>
<li>How to draw graphs of functions with one input.</li>
<li>How to draw graphs of functions with two inputs.</li>

<li>How to show inverse functions graphically. (flip_coord)</li>
<li>The R functions implementing exponential, logarithmic, sine and cosine relationships.</li>
<li>How to make graphics with semi-log and log-log axes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new R functions you will see are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>makeFun()</code> – turns a tilde-expression into a function</li>
<li><code>slice_plot()</code> – graphs a function with one input</li>
<li><code>domain()</code> – sets the extent of the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis (the “domain”)</li>
<li><code>c()</code> – collects its argument together into a <span title="A vector is a collection of two or more numbers." style="text-decoration: underline">vector</span>.</li>

<h2>Formulas to functions</h2>
<p>A formula is a mathematical expression that describes an arithmetic calculation. For example, <span class="math inline">\(m c^2\)</span> is a formula introduced by Albert Einstein to describe the energy of a particle as a function of mass and the speed of light.</p>
<p>Math textbooks love to write functions using <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, for instance,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y =  5 + 2 x . \]</span></p>
<p>In this traditional notation, the formula is on the right-hand side of <code>=</code>. The <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> on the left-hand side of <code>=</code> is more or less meaningless. There is nothing explicit in the notation to say what the input(s) are to the function.</p>
<p>In the MMAC textbook, they use this traditional notation often. In our own notes, we will use a better mathematical notation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x) \equiv 5 + 2 x .\]</span> You may wonder what makes this notation better. Clearly, it is more verbose. But that provides some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>the function is given a name, in this case <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</li>
<li>the argument(s) to the function are explicitly identified by the names included in the parentheses.</li>
<li>using <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span> reminds us that this is a definition of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, rather than a statement that the left side happens to be equal to the right side.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider Einstein’s energy formula. The function based on this formula could be written:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E(m)  \equiv m c^2 .\]</span> Notice that <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is simply a function of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. That’s because the speed of light is <em>constant</em>, roughly 300,000km per second.</p>
<p>Let’s implement <span class="math inline">\(E(m)\)</span> as an R function. We’ll do this with a tilde expression that specifies not only the formula (<span class="math inline">\(m c^2\)</span>) but which of the symbols in the formula are variables and which not. The tilde expression for Einstein’s energy function is</p>
<pre><code>m * c^2 ~ m</code></pre>
<p>To transform the tilde expression into an R function, use <code>makeFun()</code>, like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>E &lt;- makeFun(m * c^2 ~ m)</code></pre>
<p>You might wonder how the function <code>E()</code> knows the value of <code>c</code>. That’s a topic for Chapter 2.</p>
<p>Finally, a small reminder. Traditional mathematical notation uses very extensively one-letter names, like <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. With computer notation, you can often be more effective by selecting names that remind you of what the thing you’re creating is for. For instance, perhaps better to have created a function <code>mass_energy()</code> rather than <code>E()</code>, like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mass_energy &lt;- makeFun(mass * speed_of_light^2 ~ mass)</code></pre>

<h2>Graphing functions of one variable</h2>
<p>[This section replaces the “Working in RStudio” box on p. 14 of the MMAC book.]</p>
<p>The <code>slice_plot()</code> function makes graphs of mathematical functions with a single input. As you know, it’s conventional to draw the graph with the function input on the horizontal axis and the function output on the vertical axis.</p>
<p>When making a graph, you need to choose what region of the number line the horizontal axis should cover. This region is called the <em>domain</em> of the graphic. Many mathematical functions have function domains that cover the whole number line (that is, <span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>) or the positive half of the number line (that is, 0 to <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>). But even though you can legitimately evaluate the mathematical function at any point in its function domain, it’s not possible to draw a graph that runs to <span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>. (Imagine how big the computer screen would have to be! Even a screen the size of the galaxy wouldn’t do it.) So, you have to make choices of the part of the function domain that is to be included in the graphic domain. Typically this choice is based on context: the region of interest.</p>
<p>The <code>domain()</code> function is used within <code>slice_plot()</code> to set the graphic domain. Here’s an example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>slice_plot(tanh(x) ~ x, domain(x = c(-2,4)))</code></pre>
<p><img src="MMAC-Chapter-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Just FYI, the mathematical <span class="math inline">\(\tanh()\)</span> is called the “hyperbolic tangent” or, for short, pronounced “tanch” which rhymes with “branch.” It is an example of a “sigmoidal function,” so called because it has a double bend similar to the one in the letter “S.”</p>
<p>Let’s take apart the how <code>slice_plot()</code> is used.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>slice_plot()</code> takes two arguments. The first is a tilde expression of exactly the same sort as used in <code>makeFun()</code>. The second is the domain, as produced by the <code>domain()</code> function.</p></li>
<li><p><code>domain()</code> itself takes arguments. Here, since there is only one input variable in the function, there is a single argument: a named argument with the same name as used on the right-hand side of the tilde expression. The <em>value</em> of that named argument is a pair of numbers: one specifying the left side of the graphic domain, the other specifying the right side. In our example, the argument is <code>x = c(-2, 4)</code>, setting the graphic domain to be <span class="math inline">\(-2 \leq x \leq 4\)</span>. (Domains are often written in a different notation. In that notation, the domain would be written <span class="math inline">\(x \in [-2, 4]\)</span>.)</p></li>
<li><p><code>c()</code> does something simple but essential. It collects the two numbers–here <span class="math inline">\(-2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>–into a single package. That two-number package becomes the argument <code>x</code>, allowing you to specify both ends of the graphic domain at once. Some people prefer to use the <code>range()</code> function, which is another way of producing a package of two numbers. Either will work fine.</p></li>

<h2>Functions with two or more inputs</h2>
<p>You can use <code>makeFun()</code> to turn mathematical formulas with two or more inputs into functions. It’s all a matter of the tilde expression. On the right side of the tilde, list the names of all the inputs, separating them by <code>+</code>. Like this example, from Example 1.2.10 of the MMAC textbook for a function</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x, y, z) \equiv x^2 + 7y - z .\]</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code>f &lt;- makeFun(x^2 + 7*y - z ~ x + y + z)</code></pre>
<p>Remember that on the right side of the tilde, <code>x + y  + z</code> here, the <code>+</code> symbol means simply “and” or “as well as,” not mathematical addition. Some people prefer to use <code>&amp;</code> rather than <code>+</code> to avoid giving the wrong impression. That’s fine.</p>
<p>On the left side of the tilde, <code>x^2 + 7*y - z</code> here, the symbols <code>+</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>-</code> do have exactly their ordinary arithmetic meaning.</p>
<p>Plotting a function of two variables can be done in several ways. In these note (and in the MMAC book), we prefer to use a contour-plot format. Contour plots are produced by <code>contour_plot()</code> which takes two arguments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A tilde expression with two variables on the right of the tilde, e.g. <code>x + y</code> or <code>capital + labor</code>.</li>
<li>A domain produced by <code>domain()</code> used with two arguments, one for each of the inputs listed in the tilde expression.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, consider the function</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g(x, y) \equiv 5 - x - y/2\]</span> and suppose we want to plot it over the domain <span class="math inline">\(-5 \leq x \leq 5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-7 \leq y \leq 7\)</span>. You can accomplish this with</p>
<pre class="r"><code>contour_plot(
  5 - x - y/2 ~ x + y,
  domain(x = c(-5,5), y = c(-7, 7))
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="MMAC-Chapter-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Since the tilde expression and the <code>domain()</code> specification are typographically long, for clarity I’ve put each of the two arguments to <code>contour_plot()</code> on it’s own line. Notice that the two arguments are separated by a comma in the usual fashion. Notice as well that the closing function-application parenthesis for <code>contour_plot()</code> is on its own line. Such formatting is helpful for the human reader and works well with R.</p>
<p>The assignment of variables to the horizontal and vertical axes is established by the order of the named arguments to <code>domain()</code>.</p>
<p>Recall that in a contour plot, each individual contour shows the set of inputs at which the <em>output</em> of the function is a certain level that’s labeled on the contour. The levels displayed in the plot are, by default, selected by <code>contour_plot()</code> to give a fair display of the range of function outputs over the graphic domain of the plot. To keep the plot from becoming overburdened with labels, <code>contour_plot()</code> will omit some of the labels. So in the example above, the contours are for function outputs of -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. But there are labels only for -2, 2, 6, and 10.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will want to choose for yourself the output levels at which a contour will be drawn and label every contour rather than skipping. You can accomplish this by giving additional named arguments to <code>contour_plot()</code>, for instance:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>contour_plot(
  5 - x - y/2 ~ x + y,
  domain(x = c(-5,5), y = c(-7, 7)),
  contours_at = c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12),
  skip = 0
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="MMAC-Chapter-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>By default, <code>contour_plot()</code> uses two modes to display the function: the contours as well as a color fill where the color indicates the output value at each point. This works pretty well on a computer display, but occasionally you may want to turn off the fill. To accomplish this, use the <code>filled = FALSE</code> named argument.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>contour_plot(
  5 - x - y/2 ~ x + y,
  domain(x = c(-5,5), y = c(-7, 7)),
  contours_at = c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12),
  skip = 0,
  filled = FALSE
  )</code></pre>

<h2>Surface plots</h2>
<p>Occasionally, it’s helpful to display a function of two variables as if it were a three-dimensional object with the two inputs constituting two of the dimensions and the output represented by the third dimension. When the function is smooth, the output will a surface suspended above the input axes, analogous to an awning suspended over the two dimensions of a backyard patio.</p>
<p>Surface plots can be cool looking, but they can be hard to interpret quantitatively and it’s practically impossible to compare two or more functions in surface plots. That’s why we mostly use contour plots in displaying functions of two variables.</p>
<p>To make a surface plot, use the <code>interactive_plot()</code> function, which takes a tilde expression and a graphic domain as arguments, just like <code>contour_plot()</code>.</p>

<h2>Graphing two functions together</h2>
<p>Many physical, economic, and social science phenomena involve a balance between two or more factors. For example, micro-economics is famously about the balance of supply and demand.</p>
<p>Both the supply of a good (the quantity brought to market) and the demand (the quantity actually purchased) are functions of price. The lower the price, the higher the demand; people prefer things that are less expensive. But at a low price, sellers have little incentive to bring the good to market. The graph displays this schematically.</p>
<p><img src="MMAC-Chapter-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>As you can see, there is one price that leads to demand being exactly in balance with supply. The mathematical process of finding such a price is called “solving simultaneously for price the supply function and the demand function.” Or, stated more brusquely, find the price where the graphs of the two functions intersect.</p>
<p>Later, when we study differential equations, we’ll see a mechanism by which a market price changes to balance supply and demand.</p>
<p>With <code>slice_plot()</code> you can draw a graph of a function of one variable. You can “chain” multiple <code>slice_plot()</code> commands together to put multiple graphs on the same axis. The syntax is this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>slice_plot(demand(price) ~ price, 
           domain(price = c(0,100)),
           color = &quot;green&quot;
           ) %&gt;%
  slice_plot(supply(price) ~ price, 
             color = &quot;blue&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="MMAC-Chapter-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Comment on the <code>%&gt;%</code> symbol. <code>slice_plot()</code> is arranged to accept an optional input: a graph that’s already been made. When such an input is given, <code>slice_plot()</code> adds the new graph to the graph provided as input. You can add as many layers of such graphics as you like. <code>slice_plot()</code> provides a <code>label_text=</code> argument that puts a label you provide on the plot, positioning it at the height of the function. For instance, in the example that started this section, <code>slice_plot()</code> was given the argument <code>label_text = "Supply"</code>. The quotation marks around the label are essential.</p>
<p>An alternative to plotting two graphs on top of one another and looking for the crossing points (if any) is to construct a single function that is the <em>difference</em> between the two functions. For instance:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>excess_demand &lt;- makeFun(demand(price) - supply(price) ~ price)
slice_plot(excess_demand(price) ~ price, domain(price = c(0, 100)))</code></pre>
<p><img src="MMAC-Chapter-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>According to the graph, for prices below about $50, demand exceeds supply, while for prices above about $70 there is excess supply compared to demand. Where the graph crosses an output of zero, demand and supply are equal.</p>
<p>Looking for the zero-crossing of a difference function is a perfect sensible way to see whether the two functions produce the same output for a given input. But sometimes you won’t want the trouble of reading the x-axis to find a precise value of the input where the zero-crossing happens. An alternative, not involving graphics, is to use <code>findZeros()</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, to find the price where supply and demand are equal, apply <code>findZeros()</code> to the difference function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>findZeros(excess_demand(price) ~ price)</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":[""],"name":["_rn_"],"type":[""],"align":["left"]},{"label":["price"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"56.6412","_rn_":"1"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>Evaluating supply and demand at that price shows that they are indeed equal:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>demand(56.64)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 833.6505</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>supply(56.64)</code></pre>

<pre class="r"><code>contour_plot(
  terrain(latitude, longitude) ~ latitude + longitude,
  domain(longitude = c(-99, -106 ), latitude = c(33, 43)), 
  contours_at = 1.5       
)</code></pre>

<h2>Exponentials etc.</h2>
<p>There’s not much to say about the exponential, sine, cosine, and log functions. In R they correspond to <code>exp()</code>, <code>sin()</code>, <code>cos()</code>, and <code>log()</code> respectively.</p>
<ul>
<li>The argument to <code>sin()</code> and <code>cos()</code> (and other trigonometric functions) is always given in <em>radians</em> rather than degrees. If you have an input specified in degrees, you’ll have to convert it to radians. For fun, we’ll write the conversion function here:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>degrees_to_radians &lt;- makeFun(
  degrees * pi / 180 ~ degrees
)</code></pre>

<div id="section-function-inverses-and-monotonicity" class="section level2">
<h2>Function inverses and monotonicity</h2>
<p>The <em>inverse</em> of a function <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> is another function <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> (sometimes <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> is named <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}()\)</span>) such that applying <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> to the output of <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> produces whatever the original input to <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> was.</p>
<p>To illustrate, <code>exp()</code> and <code>log()</code> are inverse functions. For example, using 3 as the input:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>log(exp(3))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>exp(log(3))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, <code>sin()</code> and <code>cos()</code> are <em>not</em> inverses of each other, as demonstrated this way:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sin(cos(3))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] -0.8360219</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>cos(sin(3))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.9900591</code></pre>
<p>Given a function <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span>, it’s easy to plot the inverse. Let’s look at this function:</p>
<p><img src="MMAC-Chapter-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>To plot the inverse of <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> you just need to flip the horizontal and vertical axes, like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>slice_plot(f(x) ~ x, domain(x = c(-5, 5))) %&gt;%
  gf_refine(coord_flip())</code></pre>
<p><img src="MMAC-Chapter-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>To evaluate the inverse, choose the point you want on the <em>horizontal</em> axis and read up to the value of the function according to the vertical axis.</p>
<p>A mathematician would point out that this flipped graph shows that <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> does not have an inverse; the flipped graph fails the “vertical line” test. The mathematical definition of a function requires that the function have only one possible output for any value of the input.</p>
<p>Computing functions, however, don’t necessarily respect that definition. Certainly, function like <code>exp()</code> or <code>sin()</code> which implement mathematical function will always produce the same output for any given input. You can confirm this by running the expressions in the code block over and over again. But the functions <code>runif()</code> and <code>date()</code> don’t have this unique-output feature.</p>
